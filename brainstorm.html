          <p id="text"> Now a days people tend to forget about drinking water due to busy working. So me and my partner came up with this idea of a water drinking reminder to help people get hydrated. 
            It's a project I've done in the class of CMP521 to help with the society.

          <p id="text">I'm currently working in Tims Hortons as a part time job. I really enjoy working there
            because I have the chances of seeing many different people in this big society. I've served from 
            homeless to company managers and I've learned many things from them.

            Tennis is one of my favourite sport to play with. It is very entertaining to play with friends. Doesn't require a lot of skils 
            and it will bring a lot of fun.
